# Altspace Programming Project - TodoMVC Operations

## Instructions

Create a small virtualized/containerized environment to run a TodoMVC app.

## Goals

We use this project to get a sense of your operational chops and what kinds of approaches you take to typical problems seen in web operations. When we receive the project, here is what we will be asking ourselves:

- Does the project work? Can we get TodoMVC running in one command?
- Do the scripts provision, configure, and launch the necessary services cleanly?
- Are the scripts and the overall project well organized and clean?
- Are the extras bits included set up properly? Are they useful, relevant, or just plain cool? 

This project should take approximately 5-15 hours to complete.

To work on the project:

* Fork and clone the repo.
* Create a new folder called "Project" where you will put your work.

## Requirements

In this repo in the `todomvc` folder you'll find three implementations of TodoMVC, a simple to-do application. The three implementations are implemented in Django (Python), Rails (Ruby), or node.js (Javascript.)

Using tools like Vagrant and Docker, set up a virtual or containerized environment that runs the application that consists of at least 2 logical machines/containers talking to one another: one hosting the application server and one hosting the database. For the database, you can choose to use either MongoDB (for the node.js project) or MySQL or PostgreSQL for the Rails or Django projects. Feel free to configure or customize the application and database to suit your needs.

In addition to getting the basic system running, include some more stuff to showcase your skill and creativity. This is your chance to blow us away!

Some ideas:

- A basic monitoring/alerting setup.

- A simple deployment process for new code.

- Anything else you think would showcase your abilities as an operations engineer. Been wanting to try a new tool, scripting language, or library? Go for it!

## Deliverable

In your repo, you should clobber this README file with your own that describes the overall system architecture, how to get it up and running, details on the additional things you included like monitoring or deployment, and any design decisions you made that you think would be helpful for us to understand. Also, include a brief overview of limitations or next steps youâ€™d take if you wanted to deploy this system to production.

E-mail us a link to your Github repo to projects@altvr.com. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter.

We hope you have fun working on the project, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
